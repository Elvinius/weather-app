# weather-app

A simple weather app showing the weather forecast according to the current geolocation of the device.

Used free resources such as Darksky API and Cors-anywhere (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/).

The app has been built on Vanilla JS and Bootstrap and custom CSS were also used to style. Please note that the app should be improved as this is the simplest version.
